# Air Ticket Reservation System

There will be two types of
users of this system â€“ Customers, and Airline Staff (Administrator). Using this system, customers can
search for flights (one way or round trip), purchase flights ticket, view their future flight status or see
their past flights etc. Airline Staff will add new airplanes, create new flights, and update flight status. In
general, this will be a simple air ticket reservation system.
