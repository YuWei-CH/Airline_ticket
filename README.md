# Air Ticket Reservation System

There will be two types of
users of this system â€“ Customers, and Airline Staff (Administrator). Using this system, customers can
search for flights (one way or round trip), purchase flights ticket, view their future flight status or see
their past flights etc. Airline Staff will add new airplanes, create new flights, and update flight status. In
general, this will be a simple air ticket reservation system. 

## Instruction for this project
1. If it is through direct download or clone this repository can be used directly after. If it is downloaded by zip, you need to **decompress** it and use it again.   
2. The runnable part of the file is stored in the "Project-code" folder. This folder contains static and templates folders and backend-server.py, a python file.   
3. If you have deployed **python 3.7** or above, you can read the next step directly, if not, please download and install python runtime environment according to your operating system type. 
5. Install flask and pymysql modules in python if required.   
6. Start your mysql database server and your apache server.   
7. Go to your browser and type **"127.0.0.1"** in the address bar and click on phyMyAdmin.   
8. Open your database. Please remember the name of your database. 
9. If you used a root password for your mysql database, edit the backend-server.py file to
  write that password in and **change the "db" to your database name**.
  ```python
  conn = pymysql.connect(host='localhost',
		                   port = 8889,
                       user='root',
